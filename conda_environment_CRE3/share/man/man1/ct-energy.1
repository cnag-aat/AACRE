.SH NAME
ct-energy \- evaluate the energy of a .ct file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ct-energy
.RI [ OPTION ]...
.RI [ FILE ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBct-energy\fR evaluates the energy of each structure in each \fIFILE\fR, such as those produced by mfold or by \fBhybrid-min\fR or \fBhybrid-ss-min\fR.  In its default mode it prints the energy of each structure followed by a carriage return (but see the \fB--verbose\fR option below).
.P
When no \fIFILE\fR is specified, or if \fIFILE\fR is -, \fBct-energy\fR reads standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -n ", " --NA =RNA|DNA
sets nucleic acid type to RNA or DNA.  Default is RNA.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --temperature =\fItemp
sets temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 37.
.TP
.BR -N ", " --sodium =\fIvalue
sets Sodium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -M ", " --magnesium =\fIvalue
sets Magnesium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 0.
.TP
.BR -p ", " --polymer
use salt corrections for polymers instead of oligomers (the default).
.TP
.BR -s ", " --suffix =\fIstring
use energy rules with the suffix \fIstring\fR.  Overrides \fB--temperature\fR, \fB--sodium\fR, \fB--magnesium\fR and \fB--polymer\fR.
.TP
.BR -v ", " --verbose
causes \fBct-energy\fR to output detailed information about each loop in the structure.  Specify twice for even more verbosity.
.TP
.BR -L ", " --logarithmic
make penalty for multibranch loops logarithmic rather than linear.
.TP
.BR -V ", " --Vienna
consider single-base stacking in "Vienna mode", in which a single-stranded base that may stack on an adjacent basepair must always do so.  By default, two states are considered for each such base: dangling and not dangling.
.SH OBSCURE OPTIONS
.TP
.B --nodangle
removes single-base stacking from consideration.
.TP
.B --simple
makes the penalty for multibranch loops constant rather than affine.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP UNAFOLDDAT
an alternate location from which to read the energy rules.  The default energy rules can be overridden with files in the current directory or in the directory pointed to by UNAFOLDDAT.  \fBct-energy\fR looks for each file first in the current directory, then in the directory specified by UNAFOLDDAT and last in \fI/usr/local/share/unafold\fR (or wherever the energy rules were installed).
