.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Type::Tiny is tested with Moo 1.001000 and above.
.PP
Type::Tiny overloads \f(CW\*(C`&{}\*(C'\fR. Moo supports using objects that overload
\&\f(CW\*(C`&{}\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`isa\*(C'\fR constraints, so Type::Tiny objects can directly be used
in \f(CW\*(C`isa\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Moo prior to 1.006000 doesn't support \f(CW\*(C`coerce => 1\*(C'\fR, instead
requiring a coderef to use as a coercion. However, Type::Tiny can
provide you with a suitable coderef to use (actually an object that
overloads \f(CW\*(C`&{}\*(C'\fR). Just use:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   has age => (
\&      is      => "rwp",
\&      isa     => $PositiveInt,
\&      coerce  => $PositiveInt\->coercion,
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
If you can upgrade to the latest Moo, and use \f(CW\*(C`coerce => 1\*(C'\fR you'll
have a lot more fun though. :\-)
.PP
Type::Tiny hooks into Moo's HandleMoose interface to ensure that type
constraints get inflated to Moose type constraints if and when Moo inflates
your class to a full Moose class.
.SS "Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Optimization"
The usual advice for optimizing type constraints applies: use type constraints
which can be inlined whenever possible, and define coercions as strings rather
than coderefs.
.PP
Upgrading to Moo 1.002000 or above should provide a slight increase in speed
for type constraints, as it allows them to be inlined into accessors and
constructors.
.PP
If creating your own type constraints using \f(CW\*(C`Type::Tiny\->new\*(C'\fR, then
consider using Sub::Quote to quote the coderef; this allows you to take
advantage of inlining without having to write your own inlining routines.
.PP
