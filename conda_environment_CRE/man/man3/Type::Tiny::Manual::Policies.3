.SS "Type::Tiny Stability Policy"
.IX Subsection "Type::Tiny Stability Policy"
Type::Tiny 1.000000 is considered stable. Any changes to the \s-1API\s0 that
are big enough to \fIrequire\fR changes to the test suite will be preceded
by a \fIsix month\fR notice period, with the following exceptions:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Any changes which are necessary to maintain compatibility with new
releases of Moose, Moo, and other software that Type::Tiny needs
to integrate with.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Changes to maintain compatibility with future versions of Perl itself.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Where a change fixes a contradiction between the implementation and
documentation of Type::Tiny.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Where a feature is explicitly documented as being \*(L"experimental\*(R" or
\&\*(L"unstable\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 4
Improvements to the text of error messages.
.SS "Experimental and Unstable Type::Tiny Features"
.IX Subsection "Experimental and Unstable Type::Tiny Features"
The following list is currently non-exhaustive.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Type::Tiny inlining subs (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`inline_as\*(C'\fR) may return a list of
strings (with \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR being allowed as the first item on the list).
This is experimental. See Type::Utils.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Type::Tiny's \f(CW\*(C`my_methods\*(C'\fR attribute and the functionality it
provides is experimental.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The parameterizable coercion \s-1API\s0 is subject to change.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The interaction of deep coercions and mutable coercions currently results
in ill-defined behaviour. This could change at any time.
(See \*(L"Deep Caveat\*(R" in Type::Tiny::Manual::Coercions.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Type::Registry's ability to import MooseX::Types and MouseX::Types
type libraries is experimental.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Integration with Type::Tiny::XS.
.IP "\(bu" 4
These modules are considered part of Type::Tiny's internals, and not
covered by the stability policy:
Devel::TypeTiny::Perl56Compat,
Devel::TypeTiny::Perl58Compat,
Eval::TypeTiny,
Type::Coercion::FromMoose,
Type::Tiny::_HalfOp,
Types::Standard::ArrayRef,
Types::Standard::Dict,
Types::Standard::HashRef,
Types::Standard::Map,
Types::Standard::ScalarRef, and
Types::Standard::Tuple.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny is not covered by the stability policy.
.SS "Type::Tiny Versioning Policy"
.IX Subsection "Type::Tiny Versioning Policy"
As of 1.000000, this distribution follows a versioning scheme similar
to Moo, which is based on a semver <http://semver.org/>\-like three
component version number, but with the last two components each
represented by three decimal digits in the fractional part of the
version number. That is, version 1.003002 of the software represents
\&\*(L"1.3.2\*(R".
.PP
Additionally, releases where the second component is an odd number will
be considered unstable/trial releases. (These will also include an
underscore in the version number as per the usual \s-1CPAN\s0 convention.)
