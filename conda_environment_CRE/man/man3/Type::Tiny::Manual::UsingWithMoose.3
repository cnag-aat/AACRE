.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Type::Tiny is tested with Moose 2.0007 and above.
.PP
Type::Tiny type constraints have an \s-1API\s0 almost identical to that of
Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint. It is also able to build a
Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint constraint from a Type::Tiny constraint, and
will do so automatically when needed. When Moose.pm is loaded, Type::Tiny
will use Perl's \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR feature to proxy method calls through to the
Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object. In short, you can use a Type::Tiny
object pretty much anywhere you'd use a Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint and
you are unlikely to notice the difference.
.SS "Per-Attribute Coercions"
.IX Subsection "Per-Attribute Coercions"
Type::Tiny offers convenience methods to alter the list of coercions
associated with a type constraint. Let's imagine we wish to allow our
\&\f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR attribute to be coerced from an arrayref of strings.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&      has name => (
\&         is      => "ro",
\&         isa     => Str\->plus_coercions(
\&            ArrayRef[Str], sub { join " ", @{$_} },
\&         ),
\&         coerce  => 1,
\&      );
.Ve
.PP
This coercion will apply to the \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR attribute only; other attributes
using the \f(CW\*(C`Str\*(C'\fR type constraint will be unaffected.
.PP
See the documentation for \f(CW\*(C`plus_coercions\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`minus_coercions\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`no_coercions\*(C'\fR in Type::Tiny.
.SS "Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Optimization"
The usual advice for optimizing type constraints applies: use type constraints
which can be inlined whenever possible.
.PP
Defining coercions as strings rather than coderefs won't give you as much of
a boost with Moose as it does with Moo, because Moose doesn't inline coercion
code. However, it should still improve performance somewhat because it allows
Type::Coercion to do some internal inlining.
.PP
See also Type::Tiny::Manual::Optimization.
.SS "Interactions with MooseX-Types"
.IX Subsection "Interactions with MooseX-Types"
Type::Tiny and MooseX::Types type constraints should \*(L"play nice\*(R". If, for
example, \f(CW\*(C`ArrayRef\*(C'\fR is taken from Types::Standard (i.e. a Type::Tiny\-based
type library), and \f(CW\*(C`PositiveInt\*(C'\fR is taken from MooseX::Types::Common::Numeric,
then the following should \*(L"just work\*(R":
