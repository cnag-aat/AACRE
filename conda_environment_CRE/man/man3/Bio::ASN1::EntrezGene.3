.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene is a regular expression-based Perl Parser for \s-1NCBI\s0 Entrez
Gene genome databases (<http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene>).  It
parses an \s-1ASN\s0.1\-formatted Entrez Gene record and returns a data structure that
contains all data items from the gene record.
.PP
The parser will report error & line number if input data does not conform to the
\&\s-1NCBI\s0 Entrez Gene genome annotation file format.
.PP
Note that it is possible to provide reading of all \s-1NCBI\s0's \s-1ASN\s0.1\-formatted
files through simple variations of the Entrez Gene parser (I need more
investigation to be sure, but at least the sequence parser is a very simple
variation on Entrez Gene parser and works well).
.PP
It took the parser version 1.0 11 minutes to parse the human genome Entrez Gene
file on one 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon processor.  The addition of validation and error
reporting in 1.03 and handling of new Entrez Gene format slowed the parser down
about 40%.
.PP
Since V1.07, this package also included an indexer that runs pretty fast (it
takes 21 seconds for the indexer to index the human genome on the same
processor).  Therefore the combination of the modules would allow user to
retrieve and parse arbitrary records.

\&  Parameters: $maxerrstr (optional) \- maximum number of characters after
\&                offending element, used by error reporting, default is 20
\&  Example:    $parser\->maxerrstr(20);

\&  Parameters: $filename for file that contains Entrez Gene record(s)
\&  Example:    $parser\->input_file($filename);
\&  Function:   Takes in name of a file containing Entrez Gene records.
\&              opens the file and stores file handle
\&  Returns:    none.
\&  Notes:      Attempts to open file larger than 2 GB even on Perl that
\&                does not support 2 GB file (accomplished by calling
\&                "cat" and piping output. On OS that does not have "cat"

\&              file or \-file => $filename (optional) \- name of the file to be

\&              fh or \-fh => $filehandle (optional) \- handle of the file to be
\&                parsed.
\&  Example:    my $parser = Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene\->new();
\&  Function:   Instantiate a parser object
\&  Returns:    Object reference
\&  Notes:      Setting file or fh will reset line numbers etc. that are used
\&                for error reporting purposes, and seeking on file handle would

\&  Parameters: $string that contains Entrez Gene record,

\&                returned should be trimmed. 2 is recommended and

\&                be reset
\&              DEPRECATED as external function!!! Do not call this function

\&                Gene record.

\&  Parameters: $trimopt (optional) that specifies how the data structure
\&                returned should be trimmed. option 2 is recommended and
\&                default
\&  Example:    my $value = $parser\->next_seq();
\&  Function:   Use the file handle generated by input_file, parses the next
\&                the record and returns a data structure.
\&  Returns:    A data structure containing all data items from the Entrez
\&                Gene record.
\&  Notes:      Must pass in a filename through new() or input_file() first!
\&              For details on how to use the $trimopt data trimming option
\&                please see comment for the trimdata method. An option
\&                of 2 is recommended and default
\&              The acceptable values for $trimopt include:
\&                1 \- trim as much as possible
\&                2 (or 0, undef) \- trim to an easy\-to\-use structure
\&                3 \- no trimming (in version 1.06, prior to version
\&                    1.06, 0 or undef means no trimming)

\&  Parameters: $hashref or $arrayref
\&              $trimflag (optional, see Notes)
\&  Example:    trimdata($datahash); # using the default flag
\&  Function:   recursively process all attributes of a hash/array
\&              hybrid and get rid of any arrayref that points to
\&              one\-element arrays (trims data structure) depending on
\&              the optional flag.
\&  Returns:    none \- trimming happenes in\-place
\&  Notes:      This function is useful to compact a data structure produced by

\&  Notes:      Use with care!

The parse_entrez_gene_example.pl script included in this package (please
see the Bio\-ASN1\-EntrezGene\-x.xx/examples directory) is a very
important and near-complete demo on using this module to extract all data
items from Entrez Gene records.  Do check it out because in fact, this
script took me about 3\-4 times more time to make for my project than the
parser V1.0 itself. Note that the example script was edited to leave
out stuff specific to my internal project.
.PP

uses/benchmarks the modules, please see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/egparser/>.
