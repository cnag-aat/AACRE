# AACRE
The AACRE pipeline (Assembly and Annotation of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) is a Snakemake-based workflow that was developed to automatically process, assemble and annotate Carbapenem-Resistant enterobactericiae that have been sequenced with Illumina and ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). It takes as input fastq files and takes care of pre-processing the reads, performing the hybrid assembly and annotating the assembl√±ed genomes with special attention on genes involved in conferring resistance to antiobiotics. 
All the needed software has been installed under conda environments. It should be launched with the "conda_environment_CRE" environment loaded. Only two steps use any of the other environments and the pipeline itself loads the correct one during the process.
